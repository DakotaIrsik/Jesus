# Jesus Platform Charter

## Vision

Jesus is an enterprise-grade, MCP-based agentic AI orchestration platform designed to run on dedicated hardware with pluggable model adapters, intelligent routing with explicit fallback chains, and comprehensive observability. The platform enables organizations to deploy, monitor, and scale AI agents with production-grade reliability, security, and cost controls.

## Mission

Deliver a robust, commercially-viable AI agent orchestration platform that:
- Supports both local (on-premises) and remote (cloud API) model execution
- Provides transparent model routing with automatic fallback capabilities
- Ensures reproducible, auditable agent runs with comprehensive artifact retention
- Enables cost-effective operations through intelligent resource scheduling and budget controls
- Maintains enterprise security standards with PII redaction, secret management, and audit logging

## Goals

### Primary Goals (M0-M2)
1. **Model Adapter Framework**: Pluggable adapters for Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT-4, local models (llama.cpp, vLLM), with standardized interfaces
2. **Intelligent Routing**: Context-aware model selection with explicit fallback chains (e.g., GPT-4 → Claude-3.5 → local fallback)
3. **Agent Runner**: Stateful task execution with retry logic, graph dependencies, and artifact collection
4. **Observability**: Real-time metrics, distributed tracing, and Grafana dashboards for QPS, token usage, cost, and latency (P50/P95/P99)
5. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated build, test, security scanning, and deployment with canary releases

### Secondary Goals (M3-M4)
6. **Budget Enforcement**: Per-user, per-team, and per-run spend caps with real-time alerting
7. **Resource Scheduling**: GPU-aware task queue with priority lanes and fair scheduling
8. **Developer Experience**: CLI tools, REST/gRPC APIs, and comprehensive documentation
9. **Advanced Evaluation**: Golden eval harness with task-based metrics and regression detection
10. **Production Hardening**: Chaos engineering, disaster recovery runbooks, and threat modeling

## Scope

### In Scope
- Multi-model orchestration (local + cloud providers)
- Model Context Protocol (MCP) tool integration
- Task scheduling and execution with retry policies
- Cost tracking and budget enforcement per run/user/team
- Artifact storage and retrieval (logs, traces, model outputs)
- Comprehensive telemetry (metrics, logs, traces)
- Security guardrails (PII redaction, secret management, audit logging)
- CI/CD with automated testing and deployment
- Kubernetes-native deployment with Helm charts
- Developer tools (CLI, web dashboard, APIs)

### Out of Scope
- Custom model training or fine-tuning infrastructure
- Multi-tenancy across organizational boundaries (single org focus)
- Real-time streaming for end-user applications (batch/task-oriented)
- Mobile client SDKs
- Built-in vector database management (external integration only)

## Architecture Principles

1. **Modularity**: Clear separation between adapters, router, runner, scheduler, and observability
2. **Pluggability**: Easy addition of new model adapters without core system changes
3. **Fail-Safe**: Graceful degradation with fallback chains; never fail silently
4. **Observable**: All operations emit metrics, logs, and traces with correlation IDs
5. **Secure by Default**: PII redaction, secret management via OIDC, least-privilege access
6. **Cost-Aware**: Track and enforce spending at every level (run, user, team, org)
7. **Cloud-Native**: Kubernetes deployments with horizontal scaling and health checks
8. **Testable**: Comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end tests in CI

## Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

## Risks and Mitigations
